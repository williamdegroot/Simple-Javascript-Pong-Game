Welcome to two-player Pong!

How to play:
- Player 1 uses the 'up' and 'down' arrow keys to move their paddle.
- Player 2 uses 'w' and 's' to move their paddle (up and down respectively).

Game features:
- At the beginning of each point, the pong ball resets to its center position and moves with randomized X-axis and Y-axis velocities towards either player 1 or player 2. Roughly 50% of the time, the ball will be served in the direction of player 1 and likewise with player 2.
- Points are totaled at the top of the screen.
- The game ends when one player reaches 10 points. To play again either re-run the code or refresh the browser.
- Realistic bouncing is achieved by separating velocities in the X and Y directions.
- Paddles cannot be moved off of the screen.

Suggestions:
- It is rather fun to control both paddles and 'play against yourself.' 
- This is a good beginner project.




Enjoy!
